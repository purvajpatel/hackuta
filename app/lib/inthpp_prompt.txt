Now here is the generated chisel.hpp file from the parser generator, please create the interpreter based on this information. The entry point of the interpreter should be a global function called **interpreter** and it MUST be called interpreter that takes exactly 1 node parameter and interprets the tree accordingly. Make sure to include builtins in the environment
The entry point of the function must be a NODE **pointer** as per the spec, do not interchange between pointer and reference for the entry point, ONLY use a pointer.

You are ALSO given the SPEC and EXAMPLE that you generated EARLIER for the BUILTINS that also need to be included in the environment.

DO NOT include ANY natural language, just the code block with the code. 
NO MAIN FUNCTION, entrypoint is defined with your interpreter function, your main function WILL cause an error
